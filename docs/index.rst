Introduction
------------

Django by default, has a large collection of possible types that can be used to define the

case, we will look the integrating of PostgreSQL native uuid field with Django.

Compatible with both: python3.3+ and python2.7+

---------------

You can clone the repo from github and install with simple python setup.py install
command. Or use a pip, for install it from Python Package Index.

Quickstart
----------

**djorm-ext-pguuid** exposes a simple django model field `djorm_pguuid.fields.UUIDField`.

This is a sample definition of model using a UUIDField:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from djorm_pguuid.fields import UUIDField
    from djorm_expressions.models import ExpressionManager

    class Register(models.Model):
        # auto_add keyword parameter ensure a random
        # uuid generation if it is not specified.
        id = UUIDField(auto_add=True, primary_key=True)
        name = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True)

        objects = ExpressionManager()



Creating objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a sample example of creating objects with uuid fields.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import uuid
    >>> Register.objects.create(id=uuid.UUID("01234644-0126-0113-0123-1123426749ab"))
    <Register: Register object>
    >>> Register.objects.create(id="01234644-0126-0113-0123-1123426749ab")
    <Register: Register object>
